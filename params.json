Examples would include:\r\n* Support for other Operating systems than the Debian-based Linux distributions\r\n* More fine-grained control over mount options\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to contribute to this project by forking it and submitting pull requests to the project maintainers (organization: iteego, current maintaners: mpemer and mbjarland)\r\n","name":"Puppet.s3fs-c","tagline":"Puppet module for s3fs-c","google":""}
