## S3fs-c puppet module

The s3fs-c puppet module allows you to mount Amazon S3 buckets
as a part of your file system.

You would include the module under your puppet modules directory
as a git submodule, like so:

    cd <your puppet repo>/modules
    git submodule add git@github.com:iteego/puppet.s3fs-c.git s3fs-c
    git submodule update

Don't forget to commit your submodule ref in your parent repository!

## Example Usage

After this is done, you can use the submodule like so:

    include s3fs-c

    .
    .
    .
    # Run this once:
    s3fs-c::s3fs_installation { 's3fs_installation': }

    # Run one of these for each mount point you want
    # note that the buckets have to exist
    # the module does not automatically create them...
    #
    s3fs-c::s3fs_mount { 'some-unique-name-of-your-choice':
      bucket            => '<YOUR BUCKET NAME>',
      access_key        => '<YOUR ACCESS KEY>',
      secret_access_key => '<YOUR SECRET ACCESS KEY>',
      owner             => '<YOUR DESIRED OWNER USER NAME OF MOUNT POINT>',
      group             => '<YOUR DESIRED OWNER GROUP NAME OF MOUNT POINT>',
      mode              => '<YOUR DESIRED PERMISSIONS OF MOUNT POINT>',
    }


After the resource has been put in place by puppet, assuming your credentials
were correct, you will have a mounted bucket at /mnt/s3/\<bucket-name\>

## Future Improvements

There are several areas where this module could be improved. Examples would include:
* Support for other Operating systems than the Debian-based Linux distributions
* More fine-grained control over mount options
